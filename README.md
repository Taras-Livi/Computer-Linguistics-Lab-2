# Computer-Linguistics-Lab-2
Using IMDB review dataset I finetuned a Bert model, for the second laboratory work for the course of Computer Linguistics
To load it on your machine unarchive the dataset directory and place it in a directory analogue to jupyther root and place the .ipynb there (on the root).
Also uncomment the lines regarding downloading bert data, and comment them later if needed.
